title: Sometimes the question is wrong
---

So I came across this interview of Elon Musk which I handily link here:

[![Elon Musk interview](http://img.youtube.com/vi/cIQ36Kt7UVg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIQ36Kt7UVg)

It is an interview, where, among other questions, Elon explain in simple words how [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
can be defeated in organizations.

He summarized the law to:

> The product errors reflect the organizational errors.

The problem of organizations is the boundary between teams: they create implicit constraints. 
People design around these implicit constraints and slow themself down, or, worse, they miss some optimization opportunities. Or even entire solutions.

## Sometimes the question is wrong

Elon suggests that to avoid that we need to always question constraints: sometimes the constraints are wrong or inexistent.

> The constraints that you are given are guaranteed to [be] some degree wrong. [...] Because the counterpoint would be that they are perfect.
> [...] One of the biggest traps of smart engineers is optimizing a thing that shouldn't exist

He even quoted Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy: the big computer outputted "42",
but the hardest problem was finding the right question: sometimes finding the right question is harder than finding the answer, and sometimes the question itself is wrong.
