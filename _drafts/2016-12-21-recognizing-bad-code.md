As Venkat Subramaniam says in [this great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llGgO74uXMI):

> Recognizing bad code is easier than writing good one. And I'm very good at recognizing bad code.

I'm adding my bit to that, which is:

> Recognizing bad code is easier than writing good one, that's why code reviews work.
