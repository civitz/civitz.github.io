Multiple screw terminals can be arranged in the form of a barrier strip (as illustrated at the top right), with a number of short metal strips separated by a raised insulated "barrier" on an insulating "block" - each strip having a pair of screws with each screw connecting to a separate conductor, one at each end of the strip. These are known as connector strips or chocolate blocks ("choc blocks") in the UK. This nick-name arises from the first such connectors made in the UK by GEC, Witton in the 1950s. Moulded in brown plastic they were said to resemble a small bar of chocolate. [from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_terminal]
