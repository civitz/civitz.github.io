title: Audio-technica ATH-M50x for the music-conscious silent developer
---

I am a silent developer.

I like to be in a quiet room and to reach deep focus on what I do. 

This means I'm not comfortable in an open-space office, but that's exactly the enviroment I work in.
What to do then? Of course I use headphones and push that volume **UP**.

But which headphones? One could go with the cheapest the could find and hope they isolate you from the external enviroment... but I had some more clear requirements. More specifically i needed a pair of headphones that:

- are over-the-ears: I need my ears covered to maximize isolation
- are closed-back: I don't want my colleagues to be bothered by my music
- are isolating: the two above do not guarantee that headphones isolates you from the external enviroment
- have decentl build quality
- have soft pads/are comfortable: for using long them long hours
- have almost-monitor frequency response: I'm no music head or audiophile, but if headphones/source does not deliver a decent sound quality, I prefer to avoid listening to music altogether

And, of course:

- sells at a decent price: ideally under 200â‚¬


As you can see those are pretty clear (and stringent) requirements. 

I've done some research on the Internet, and luckily one of my favorite youtubers came out with a good candidate: the Audio-technica ATH-M50x, see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5DyEYuvF3o) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEjwyYOFwZg) videos.
