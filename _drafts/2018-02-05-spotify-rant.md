## Spotify does not make sense for musically curious people

Bla bla local minimas form a serie of cliques which are very hard to escape. 

Listened to Madonna once? Here's Michael Jackson
Listened to Girl from Ipanema? You'll surely like these 10 brazilian artist you've never heard about.

the ******* algorithm spotify uses for recommended artists

once you fall in a local minima it _instantly_ settles you in a fucking clique, where everything is related to everything _within_ the clique, but with nothing outside it

f*** collaborative filtering

also: why on hell should I listen to the spice girl? I've listened Madonna because she has *PERFECT* production, not because I love '90 teenage music. I have djent artists in my listening history, why don't spotify aknowledge this?


I've seen a post regarding their filtering and recommendation engine: they have all the data and all the ML power at their hands, and yet they do a poor job for the musically literated listeners...


They do a decent job for mainstream listeners though. Or wait...do they?
