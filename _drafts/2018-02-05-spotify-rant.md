## Spotify does not make sense for musically curious people

So you have a spotify account because you love music.
You care a lot about quality of music, and you try everything: Piano solo? [Check](https://open.spotify.com/track/0T4KV1pj8as2xvdHZAP5ae?si=ePyL2TziT2qL5FQqVLfSKw). Acoustic fingerstyle? [Sure](https://open.spotify.com/track/1G4WAevBC1nzpEsmR90M0A?si=tq5ZvT7gSAGLMwi_NWAJ5Q). Glitch electronica? [Very yes](https://open.spotify.com/track/36mKvcSraxyyLzJimZAh4l?si=DgRtv_FtRmaUypOcV7nkBw). Vegetarian progressive grindcore? [Areyoukiddingme..yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hreqn9j3PHI)!

And you thought it was a good idea to settle for the most common service for music streaming, so there it is, your account.
At first you listen progressively to what is known to you, in the hope that the system somehow help you find more music that you like.

But then, the great surprise: a the beginning everithing is alright, you listen to Keith Jarret, Philip Glass pops out. Nice, let's try something else: Opeth? Spotify suggests some Cynic work. All good.

And then, after a while, you feel a little stale... is it because it's the 100th time Porcupine Tree appears in your "Discover" page? You can never get enough Porcupine Tree, don't ya?
Sometimes you get surprised: you hear a famous song over in an advertisement and you look for it. You find it on spotify and BOOM, suddenly everything it suggests is related to this.

You spot a pattern...

Listened to Madonna once? Here's Michael Jackson
Listened to Girl from Ipanema? You'll surely like these 10 brazilian artist you've never heard about. But maybe you just wanted Girl from Ipanema _once_.

This is [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) in action. A bunch of people listen to similar songs, and the algorithm picks from the common pool if you happen to listen one of pool's songs.

The problem with collaborative filtering is that it creates filter bubbles, areas where you can enter but not exit: once you start listening to songs _inside_ the bubble, you get recommended the same songs over and over.

This is why you get recommended Spice girls if  you've listened Madonna _once_. Sorry Spotify, nothing bad to say about Spice Girls, but I like Madonna because she has *PERFECT* production, not because I love '90 teenage music. I have [djent](https://open.spotify.com/track/0PYlcAw00yb0Sfy1UqSP4t?si=oPIeWdSfQkyGWOdQlB0vcw) artists in my listening history, why don't Spotify aknowledge this?

I've seen [a post](https://hackernoon.com/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe) regarding their filtering and recommendation engine: they have all the data and all the ML power at their hands, and yet they do a poor job for the musically curious listeners...

They do a decent job for mainstream listeners though. Or wait...do they?
