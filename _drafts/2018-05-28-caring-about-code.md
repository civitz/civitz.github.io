# Caring about code

What does testing and code review, have in common? These are all ways to make you face your own work, forcing you to mentally check and re-check what you have done.

### TDD and testing in general
Test driven development makes you forge your code in such a way it's easy to test. Code like this tends to be more modular and easier to reason about. It does this by [making you think about the interface of your code, rather than the algorithm behind it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr1E9aVnBxw). By testing you are also sure that your code works as intended (well, most of the times).

### Code review
Code review is a way to check that your code is not obviously wrong. Colleagues have a look at each other's code and together they find bugs or ways to improve the quality of your work. Code that makes it through code review tends to be easier to understand (because it was understood by at least one person other than you) and generally more correct.

## So what?
