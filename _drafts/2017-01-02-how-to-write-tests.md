title: How I Write Tests
---

In this [fantastic article](https://blog.nelhage.com/2016/12/how-i-test/) by Nelson Elhage there are some gems that I share to you:

> Avoid running main [...] Instead, as soon as I’ve added a feature, if I find myself itching to try it out by hand, I’ve learned to recognize that urge, pause, and step back and write an automated test covering whatever behavior I was about to execute by hand.

> If testing your application in code is hard or frustrating, it’s worth the effort to invest in your own testing tooling to make it easier!

> Encode every single bug you find as a test, to ensure that you’ll notice if you ever encounter it again.

The last one marries well with [the boy scout rule](2017-01-02-boy-scout-rule.md)
