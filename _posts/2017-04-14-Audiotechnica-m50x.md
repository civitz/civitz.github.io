title: Audio-technica ATH-M50x for the music-conscious silent developer
---

I am a silent developer.

I like to be in a quiet room and to focus deeply on what I do. 

This means I'm not comfortable working in an open-space office -- which unfortunately is exactly the kind of environment I have to cope with.
How? Of course, by putting on a pair of trusty headphones and pushing that volume **UP**.

But which headphones? One could just go with the cheapest pair one could find, and hope for sufficient isolation from the external environment... But I have clearer requirements. More specifically, I need a pair of headphones that:

- are over-the-ear: I need my ears covered to maximize isolation
- are closed-back: I don't want my colleagues to be bothered by my music
- isolate well: the previous two requirements alone do not guarantee that the headphones isolate you from the external environment
- have decent build quality: I want not to worry about handling my headphones when I’m absorbed by work
- have soft pads/are comfortable: for long hours of use
- have a pleasant sound (with a relatively flat frequency response): I'm no audiophile, but if the headphones do not deliver a decent sound quality, I’d rather avoid listening to music altogether

And, of course:

- sell at a decent price: ideally under 200€


As you can see, those are pretty clear and strict requirements. 

I've done some research on the Internet, and luckily one of my favorite youtubers came out with a good candidate: the Audio-technica ATH-M50x -- see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5DyEYuvF3o) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEjwyYOFwZg) videos.

These headphones tick all the boxes, and sell [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.it/Technica-ATH-M50X-Cuffie-Monitor-Professionali/dp/B00HVLUR86) for less than 200€ (or around 200$).

Best of all, their frequency response is fairly flat. In fact, the lower frequencies are enhanced ever so slightly, but the overall sound is pleasant and detailed.

I hope that this post will help you choosing the right headphones for you ;)
