I had a chance of promoting [civitz/viper](https://github.com/civitz/viper) on Adam Bien's airhacks.tv series.

You can find the awesome adam bien series on airhacks.tv, and the episode with viper is [here](https://adambien.blog/roller/abien/entry/jax_rs_error_serialization_viper):

It turns out developing a large array of tests was appreciated :)

Thanks Adam for reviewing the library!
