title: A note taking system in vscode
---

I keep all my notes and interesting files in a single directory (e.g. `$HOME/documents`) and open Visual Studio Code using that directory as base folder.

Now I have
- fuzzy search out of the box for files (assuming I have some sort of naming conventions)
- a fast full-text search
- ready-to-use syntax highlighting for code snippets
- rendering for images/gifs
